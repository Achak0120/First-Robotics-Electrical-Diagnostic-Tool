# Project Overview

## Purpose
This project is designed to help with First Robotics Pit Crews maintain electrical diagnostics for robots in-between matches. This application will parse voltage and current data, analyze powered electronics, and detect electrical failures in real time.

This diagnostic tool is primarily for Windows Operating Systems 10+, but we plant to incorporate iOS integration.

The primary audience of this project are coaches, mentors, and electrical/software students in First Robotics. This project aims to provide an easy-to-understand overview of the current state of the robot, and help students learn how to approach electrical issues that may arise.
